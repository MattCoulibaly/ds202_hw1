Matt committed "first commit hw_1" with id: 686760d7524343e0cb029a848dac047248fee4c6

I couldn't knit Matt's homework 1 because the image file wasn't in the repopsitory.

We encoutered a problem trying to clone a folder with the same name as the homework 1 I already had, so I had to look up how to name the folder we clone into.
