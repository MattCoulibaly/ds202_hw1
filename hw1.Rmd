## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
version
```

Have you ever thought why we are not able to successfully vaccinate people against deadly viruses like the **H1N1** virus and the **Nipah** virus, the reason is that every year these viruses undergo evolution rendering previous vaccination as useless. However using *data science* we can predict the evolution in these viruses and vaccinate people accordingly. This can **massively reduce death tolls** due to these deadly viruses.
